# markdown-visual

This is a simple markdown visualizer for Power BI. 
It is based on [showdown.js](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) and does not require any external dependencies.

> **Note:** The visual does not make any attempt to sanitize the HTML generated by showdown.js.
> It is therefore recommended to only use this visual with trusted markdown.

The visual is not (yet) available in the official marketplace, but can be installed from the [latest release](https://github.com/emil-eklund/markdown-visual/releases/latest).
